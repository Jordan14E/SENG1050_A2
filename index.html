			<h2>About Jim's Cars Marketplace</h2>		<!--Subheading for welcome section-->
			<br>
			<div id="welcome">				<!--Providing formatting for the welcome paragraph-->
				<p>Here at Jim’s cars, we are a team of motor enthusiasts who <strong>love</strong> the excitement and anticipation of a new car.
				In an effort to bring you this same feeling we have created the Jim’s cars online marketplace.
				This site is designed to allow customers to sell their cars, browse for a new car or arrange a swap of cars.
				At this present time we are only taking listings for sports cars and <abbr title="four wheel drive">4WD</abbr>s but we anticipate an accelerated rate of inclusion for other vehicle types.
				We encourage users to browse our listings and arrange transactions with other car owners over our site.
				Please always show courtesy and respect to owners, buyers and swappers.
				<br>Thank you for choosing us!
				<br>Happy Hunting!

						“On-road, the vehicles are really exceptional — exceeding what you’d see in a performance SUV ... Off-road, they’re really transformational."</blockquote>
						<p class="description">Due to the specially designed Quad-motor system, the ute holds an incredible amount of extra storage space
						including our favourite feature, the tunnel boot. Rivian has developed the tunnel boot system specially designed to hold a camp kitchen on a set of rollers inside.
						This is an incredibly rare listing at the moment and is perfect for those wanting to get away on an eco-friendly adventure.</p>
