        <p>This following document sets forth the Privacy Policy for the Jim\'s cars website,
        http://www.Jim'sCars.com.au.</p>

        <p>Jim\'s cars is committed to providing you with the best possible customer service experience.
        Jim\'s cars is bound by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), which sets out a number of principles concerning
            the privacy of individuals.</p>

        <h2>Collection of your personal information</h2>

            <p>There are many aspects of the site which can be viewed without providing personal information,
            however, for access to future Jim\'s cars customer support features you are required to submit
            personally identifiable information. This may include but not limited to a unique username and
                password, or provide sensitive information in the recovery of your lost password.</p>

        <h2>Sharing of your personal information</h2>

            <p>We may occasionally hire other companies to provide services on our behalf, including but not
            limited to handling customer support enquiries, processing transactions or customer freight
            shipping. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need
            to deliver the service. Jim\'s cars takes reasonable steps to ensure that these organisations
            are bound by confidentiality and privacy obligations in relation to the protection of your personal
                information.</p>
        <h2>Use of your personal information</h2>

            <p>For each visitor to reach the site, we expressively collect the following non-personally identifiable
            information, including but not limited to browser type, version and language, operating system, pages
            viewed while browsing the Site, page access times and referring website address. This collected
            information is used solely internally for the purpose of gauging visitor traffic, trends and delivering
                personalized content to you while you are at this Site.</p>

            <p>From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously
                disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future
                we will use for these new purposes only, data collected from the time of the policy change forward
                will adhere to our updated practices.</p>

        <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>Jim\'s cars reserves the right to make amendments to this Privacy Policy at any time. If you have
            objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access or use the Site.</p>

        <h2>Accessing Your Personal Information</h2>

        <p>You have a right to access your personal information, subject to exceptions allowed by law.
            If you would like to do so, please let us know. You may be required to put your request in
            writing for security reasons. Jim\'s cars reserves the right to charge a fee for searching for,
            and providing access to, your information on a per request basis.</p>
